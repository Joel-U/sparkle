Explore Operation
=================

Allows on-the-fly generation of stimuli. Presentation is limited to a single stimulus type at a time (no custom composite stimuli). To use this operation, navigate to the 'Explore' tab.

#. Select the stimulus type from the drop down menu in the top left corner. This will display the available paramters for that stimulus type.

#. Enter the Generation sample rate into the field at the bottom. Remember that your generation rate must be at least twice the highest frequency present in your stimulus.

#. The reps field represents how many repetitions of the stimuli will be presented before the display clears the raster plot and PSTH.

#. Press the start button to begin acquisition.

#. Change any of the parameters (except IO channel), and press update to commit changes.

#. Press the stop button to halt acquisition.

For a description of the acquistion parameters you see on the right side of the interface see the documentation for :ref:`modes`.
