Explore Operation
=================

Allows on-the-fly generation of stimuli. Presentation is limited to a single stimulus type at a time (no custom composite stimuli). To use this operation, navigate to the 'Explore' tab.

#. Select the appropriate settings for the input fields on the right side of the interface. For a full description of these items see :ref:`acqsettings`

#. Select the stimulus type from the drop down menu at the top of the tab. This will display the available paramters for that stimulus type.

#. Enter the desired values into the input fields for this stimulus type.

#. The reps field represents how many repetitions of the stimuli will be presented before the display clears the raster plot and PSTH.

#. Press the start button to begin acquisition.

#. Change any of the parameters (except IO channel and Acq. rate), and the stimulus will be automatically updated when you press enter, or the input loses focus.

#. Press the stop button to halt acquisition.
