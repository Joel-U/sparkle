Sonic Sparkle High-Five Data Acquisition System
===============================================

SSHF is an electrophysiology data acqusition and auditory stimulus assembly interface.

The program is divided into three different types of operation: search (explore), protocol (pre-defined), and calibration. Also, there are two different modes of acquisition: windowed (finite), and chart (continuous). Currently, only finite acquisition is available.
