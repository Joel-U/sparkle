Getting Started
================

When you first load the program a file dialog will appear. This is where you will chose an old data file to load, or enter the name of a new one to create, in the specified location. Go ahead and do that.

The main program window(s) will then load. 

Calibrating the speakers is an important part of the program. All speakers do not present all frequencies with the same intensity, with higher frequencies (ultrasonic) resulting in lower intensities. Because of this, we must document and compensate for this "frequency roll-off". If using a loaded data file that has a calibration already, you can set this under the *Options//Calibration Parameters* menu. Otherwise see the :ref:`calibration` instructions. Calibrations should be done at the start of every experiment, and especially if the speaker or listener was moved.

Once the calibration is in place, you will probably want to search around for cells. Go to the Explore tab. This allows you to present a stimulus on-the-fly while changing stimulus type and parameters. It will run continuously until stopped, and no data is saved. See the :ref:`explore` instructions for details.

If you find a cell, you may then wish to play a pre-defined set up stimuli. To setup and present lists of stimuli see :ref:`protocol`.

Data is automatically saved when running a recording protocol, and when you exit the program the data file will be closed.

User inputs to the program are saved for each user between program uses.
