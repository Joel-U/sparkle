Windowed
========

Windowed acquistion means collecting response recordings in finite time blocks. Select the *Windowed* option from the drop-down menu labeled *Mode*.

* Recording window length is in the upper right section of the interface.
* Threshold value is the voltage level for detecting spikes. This may be entered manually here, or dragged on the recording plot.
* Bin size is the time bins detected spikes are sorted into for the raster plot on the display
* Rep rate is the presenation rate for whole stimuli, in Hz. If this rate exceeds the rate allowable for the recording window length, repetitions will be presented immediately after each other (with some down-time for resetting).
* Acq. Sample rate is the sampling frequency of the response recording.
